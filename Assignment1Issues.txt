CSS Issues

Most people actually got split screen working! Nice


Using `position: sticky` to keep the header stuck to the top. 
However on Firefox/Chrome body tags are given an (8?)px margin(user agent stylesheet) so 
it creates (8?)px space on top/left/right before the page is scrolled.

Roboto font is not imported. @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap'); needs to be
at the very top of your page. Not every machine has Roboto so it has to be imported. 
Also, sans-serif is NOT the same as roboto font.

the list is not centered

No margins on form elements

Let me know about any other issues
