Rubric TBA

Mostly questions that will show us you understand what you wrote

We probably won't ask you anything super specific like "if I change the position from flex to fixed, what would it look like?"

Think of more conceptual questions, design design questions.

Since Phase 1 is more about the front end, we might ask you thinks like "Why did you do it X way instead of Y way?"

We could also ask you about your plans when hooking up your site to the backend how everything would function in general
